One researcher can have/do many sightings. Many sightings are done by one researcher.

A species can be seen many times (species have many sightings). Many sightings are of the same one species but maybe different animals.

Many Sightings happen in one habitat. One habitat can have many sightings.

Animals are of one species and one species only.


* Researchers should see animals instead of species. I think!
* If possible return added data or deleted data
* When returning a single item make sure payload contnains an object. When returning a collection payload should be an array
* Exactly Define the properties of json sent to the server.
* When a researcher is deleted. Set sightings.researchers_id to null
* What properties are updatable on researchers or animals? All of them?
* Front-end screenshot

#### Questions
* How did you handle updating a researchers
* Did you handle updating a animal or researcher that doesn't exists
* How did you handle passing something that is not a number as an id to get a species by id. 
* How would we do if when adding an animal we want to specify the species name instead of the species id and have the server figure out to what id belongs the species name.
